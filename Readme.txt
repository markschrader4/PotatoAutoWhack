Auto Potato Whack

Adapted for the free to play Steam game: "Farmer Against Potatoes Idle"

Uses OpenCV to compare keypoints from a reference image to closely related areas on a larger image. When said areas are found, uses win32 to click on them.

This can take control of the mouse, but it will timeout ~80 seconds after pressing start.

To run:
  run FAPIHelper.py
